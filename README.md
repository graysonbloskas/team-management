# team-management
## About this project 
I was tasked with creating an app that prompts a user, in integrated terminal, to create a team of developers for any given project. 
### How it works
    A user is prompted to pick between adding a Manager, an Engineer, or an Intern.
    Each of the three options presents a distinct set of prompts, such as email, github username, email, id, etc. 
    Upon completing all prompts, the user is asked if he or she wants to add an additional team member. 
    If no additional team member is needed, the user can select "Create Team"
    Once the user selects "Create Team," a new HTML file is generated within the lib folder.
